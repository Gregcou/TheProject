Style guide used
https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react

I used a linter to follow the style 
guide except for some rules i decided to omit
which can be seen at the top of each file.

An example of the style guide is using camel
case for variable names.

The emulator does not run very well on my laptop so 
it is slow but all actions still happen properly except
for sometimes the photo does not appear after it has been 
taken even though the code is there to refresh it but it
will always appear when you leave and come back to the
